# Professional Training Calendar

This project is a web application for managing and displaying course schedules, inspired by a WordPress plugin originally created by Amirsaman Pirayeshfar for the **Jihad Daneshgahi of Allameh Tabataba'i University** ([www.jalameh.ir](https://www.jalameh.ir)).

The goal is to provide a simple yet powerful interface for educational centers to list their active courses. These courses are then displayed to students in a clean, responsive, and easy-to-navigate table, allowing them to view course details and proceed with registration.

## Features

- **Admin Dashboard**: A simple interface to add, view, and delete courses.
- **Dynamic Course Table**: A public-facing view that lists all available courses.
- **Fully Responsive Design**: The table layout adapts seamlessly from desktop to mobile devices for an optimal user experience.
- **Right-to-Left (RTL) Support**: The UI is designed for RTL languages like Persian.
- **Easy Registration**: Each course includes a "Register Online" button that links directly to the specified registration URL.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for a fast, maintainable, and visually appealing application.

## How It Works

1.  **Add a Course**: Use the "Add New Course" form in the admin section to input details like the course title, training center, start date, capacity, fee, and a registration link.
2.  **Manage Courses**: The "Course Management Panel" displays all added courses, allowing administrators to review the details and delete entries as needed.
3.  **Public View**: The "Training Calendar Preview" section shows exactly how the course table will appear to students on the website. This table is designed to be embedded in any webpage (originally via a WordPress shortcode).

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Language**: Persian (UI), English (Codebase & Documentation)

## Developer

This application was designed and developed by **Amir Saman Pirayeshfar**.
